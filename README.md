### About

Emulation is a great way to experience classic gaming from many different generations, as well as to preserve games and consoles that otherwise would be lost to time.  However, obtaining ROMs to run in emulators is often associated with the stigma of piracy and other illegal acts, which can be a turnoff for a lot of people to get into retro game emulation.

The **ROM Extraction Documentation Project (RED-Project)** serves to be a repository of information and tools for legally obtaining ROMs from various products, such as game compilations and mini consoles, with clear and easy to follow documentation to (hopefully) make it as easy as possible to ethically source your own ROMs to run on any compatible emulator.
